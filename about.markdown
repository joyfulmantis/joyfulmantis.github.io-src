I am interested in programming, language, music, writing, and a whole lot of other sundry things.
Recently I have discovered functional programming and haskell and have found them both quite tantalizing.

I am occasionally on Freenode under the nickname of joyfulmantis, and I also maintain a [Github profile](https://github.com/joyfulmantis)
