I am a self-made programmer, previously a Chinese teacher. I am a native speaker of English, am comfortable in Chinese, and am intermediate in Turkish. I am interested in Programming, Linguistics and Education.

I graduated from Tianjin Foreign Studies University in 2020 with a bachelor's degree in Teaching Chinese to Speakers of Other Language.  
My thesis title was: [Research on the effect of tone drills on Chinese learner’s tone differentiation ability](./uploads/L16309_韩拿单_%20汉语国际教育.pdf)

I also maintain a [Github profile](https://github.com/joyfulmantis)
